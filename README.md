# Design-of-Bolted-Steel-Plate
This code takes the input and Solves the complete numerical step by step and gives you the step by step ans and solution of the numerical . Its only restricted to chain bolting in future it will be improved for staggered bolting. Reference IS.800-2007

This code solves the numerical with reference to IS:800-2007 But it cant solve the staggered bolting or diamond bolting yet, in the future versions i will update the repository for staggered bolting also till then it can only solve chain bolting

Note:- 1) Before using the code please be thorough with the theory if you have any problem in understanding theory then           watch on youtube you will find many videos however i will recomend Ganesh Sehgar channel for Civil engg his             videos were a lot helpful for me during my graduation. 
       2) If you have the Diameter of the bolt then find the thickness of plate using D=6.04âˆšt and then give this                 thickness value as input DON'T PUT TICKNESS (t1) = 0
       3) This code is still not perfect and it requires some improvements i will do it soon if you have any                     recomendation let me know
